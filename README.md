# Balancing-the-Imbalanced
The main purpose of the notebook is to learn sampling techniques to handle imbalanced dataset. Many beginners have never sampled data of imbalanced dataset and got an accuracy of 98% or more (considering only accuracy as performance metric) and think it’s perfect. But many fail to notice the False Positive rates they got as their result. In this notebook, we discuss about

i) Random Under Sampling.

ii) Near Miss Under Sampling.

iii) Tomek Links Under Sampling.

iv) Cluster Centroids Under Sampling.

v) Random Over Sampling.

vi) SMOTE. (Synthetic Minority OverSampling Technique)

vii) ADASYN. (Adaptive Synthetic Over Sampling)

viii) SMOTE & Tomek Links. (Combination of Under sampling and Over sampling)

A comparison of these sampling techniques and it’s explanation using Credit Card Fraud Detection.
